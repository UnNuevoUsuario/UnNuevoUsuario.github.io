        <h3>Music</h3>
        <p>I like almost all styles of music, but I special like J-pop music. My favorite singer is <a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aimer">Aimer</a>. My favorite song actually is <a href="https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Kogarashi_Sentiment">Kogarashi Sentiment</a>, made by Shin-ichiro Miki and Chiwa Sait≈ç </p>. As you can see I really love the actual oriental culture, because of that one of my goals is to travel to Japan and live the experience of being a fan there.
        <h3>Series</h3>
        <p>Related with my favorite series, I use to watch japanese series, my favorite serie is <a href="https://fate-go.us/">Fate Grand Order</a>; is a Sci-fi serie that tell us about an organization that faces calamities and singularities from the current human history, the consequences of being "human" and the heroes that have been made their mark into human history. FateGO is also a game so I spend most of my free time playing and reading the sotries that FateGo provide us.Talking about other series, I also like <a href="https://fate-go.us/">Steins;Gate</a>, a serie about time travel; this serie cover topics from casuality to time paradox and tell us a history about a young scientist that wants to make a contributions to his world.</p>

        <h3>Programming</h3>
        <p>I really like code and how we can use different languages programs in order to solve specific people neccesities. I specially like those languages that allow me to create simulations or presentations from some topics, for example HTML is capable of create beatiful webpages if you put effort love in your work.</p>
        <h3>Physics</h3>
        <p>I love Optics, both theoretical and practical knowledge. I also like to work with other topics like statistics, electronic and electrodynamics. If I would order my favorite topics, it would be:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Optics</li>
            <li>Quantum Mechanics</li>
            <li>Electrodynamics</li>
            <li>Materials Science</li>
        </ol>
